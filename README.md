Weather app with darksky api.
![weather app preview](https://github.com/gabrielacepeda/weather-app/blob/master/landing.png

A simple app that displays the current weather based on your location.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dark Sky API

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this app. On page load, the weather is displayed using your location, as well as the current time.

## Optimizations

Currently the time nor weather updates automatically. You have to manually refresh the page to display changes. A progress bar should be implemented to display while the page is loading.

## Lessons Learned:

Creating a weather app using the dark sky api was fun. I will be integrating this into a larger application.
